(ns yggdrasil.convergent.overlay
  "`Overlayable` for convergent (CRDT) systems — the UNIFORM isolate primitive.

   `overlay` clones the system with fresh mutable state at its current value; you
   mutate the clone in isolation (its normal functional ops); `merge-down!` joins
   the clone back into the parent; `discard!` drops it. Because isolation is a
   clone (fresh atoms over the SAME content-addressed store — immutable nodes), it
   works for ANY convergent system — G-Set, 2P-Set, OR-Set — so a CRDT isolates
   WITHOUT needing the named-branch model. This is what resolves the 2P/OR-Set
   `branch!`-no-op residue.

   `branch!` (Branchable) = a durable NAMED ref (git/datahike model). `overlay`
   (this) = a transient ISOLATED WORKSPACE with a fork→merge-down/discard
   lifecycle (the spindel-fork model). Complementary, not redundant.

   `mode :frozen` (isolate at the current value) is the proven path. The
   live-tracking modes `:following`/`:gated` are thin here — `advance!` re-joins
   the parent's current state into the overlay; the sequence-lock/gated machinery
   is deferred until an agent-tracking case needs it."
